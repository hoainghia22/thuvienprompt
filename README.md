## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/prompt-library.git
    cd prompt-library
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use). The server supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a fast development experience.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

The project is fully configured to be built and deployed using Docker.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Running with Docker

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    This command builds the multi-stage Docker image, which first builds the Vite project and then serves the static files using Caddy.
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```

2.  **Run the container:**
    This command starts the container in detached mode.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

The application will now be running and accessible at **`http://localhost:8000`**.

### Stopping the container

To stop the running container, use:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The PocketBase backend URL is configured in `src/index.tsx`. If you wish to connect to a different instance, you can change the following constant:

```typescript
// src/index.tsx
const POCKETBASE_URL = 'https://your-pocketbase-url.com';
```
